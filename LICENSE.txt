The Programming Language Research Group at the University of Tenten Academy is a group of
 faculty, postdocs, and students interested in programming languages and related areas.
 We meet weekly to discuss research papers and work in progress. We also host the Programming
  Languages Seminar, which brings in speakers from other institutions.

We are part of the Computer Science Department at the University of Tenten Academy.
